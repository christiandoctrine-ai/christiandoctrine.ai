              Our vision is to facilitate vibrant discussions within church
              communities by making theology more accessible. As people learn more about theology, our desire is that they discuss the concepts
              with their local church.

              This chatbot distinguishes itself from chatgpt in two ways. First, the chatbot uses sources that are carefully curated
              instead of referencing the entirety of the internet. Second, the temperature of the chatbot is set low 
              to significantly reduce hallucinations (fabricated information). In this way, the responses are designed to reference 
              canonical sources only.

              However this AI chatbot is in beta and should not be viewed as authoritative. We&#39;ve also started
              with one source but hope to expand to more in the future. If you have any feedback, please share it 
              by contacting us below.
